# FakeInventories
âœ¨A simple way to create a GUI on servers based on PocketMine-MP!âœ¨


## Features
- Fast opening without any delay
- Opening a FakeInventory behind the player so the player cannot see it
- Simple un-clicking item
- Example petterns
- Simple API
- Tested on several servers

## Installation

1. Download plugin by clicking [here](https://github.com/iDarkQ/FakeInventories/releases/download/1.0/FakeInventories_v1.phar)
2. Put the plugin into your plugins folder

## Usage

### ðŸ”»Create a file (or skip this steps and use the files that are already in the plugin)ðŸ”»

### Construct FakeInventory
```php
public function __construct(Player $player) {
    // "Test1" it's a title
    // self::LARGE_CHEST is a size of FakeInventory (for small chest just type self::SMALL_CHEST)
    // The "true" at the end is whether the FakeInventory should appear behind the player
    
    parent::__construct($player, "Test1", self::LARGE_CHEST, true);
}
```

### Setting items (you need to add this function)
```php
public function setItems() : void {
    //$this->setItem(slot, item);
    $this->setItem(0, Item::get(Item::CHEST)->setCustomName("Test1"));
}
```

### At the end actions which are to be performed after clicking on an item
```php
// $player - Player which cliekd on item
// $sourceItem - It's the item that was clicked
// $targetItem - It's the item that was clicked (almost useless)
// $slot - It's a slot which was clicked by player
public function onTransaction(Player $player, Item $sourceItem, Item $targetItem, int $slot) : bool {
    // returned value means whether transaction is cancelled or not
    // example if return value is true then transaction is cancelled otherwise not
    return true;
}
```

### Changing inventory
```php
$this->changeInventory($player, (new YourFakeInventory($player)));
```

### Closing inventory
```php
$this->closeFor($player);
```

### Opening inventory
```php
//if you want to open an inventory from a command level or another class, use
(new YourFakeInventory($player))->openFor([$player]);

//otherwise use this
$this->openFor([$player]);
```

### Un-clicking item
```php
$this->unClickItem($player);
```

### âœ¨That's all, your code should looks like thisâœ¨
```php
<?php

namespace fakeinventories\fakeinventory\inventories;

use fakeinventories\fakeinventory\FakeInventory;
use pocketmine\item\Item;
use pocketmine\Player;

class TestInventory extends FakeInventory {

    public function __construct(Player $player) {
        parent::__construct($player, "Test1", self::LARGE_CHEST);
    }

    public function setItems() : void {
        $this->setItem(0, Item::get(Item::CHEST)->setCustomName("Test1"));
    }

    public function onTransaction(Player $player, Item $sourceItem, Item $targetItem, int $slot) : bool {

        if($sourceItem->getId() === Item::CHEST)
            $this->changeInventory($player, (new YourFakeInventory($player)));

        $this->unClickItem($player);
        return true;
    }
}
```
